        This is an example single page app using the React for GitHub Pages
        boilerplate. It is built with React and React Router using
        browserHistory. Navigate with the links below and refresh the page or
        copy/paste the url to test out the redirect functionality deployed to
        overcome GitHub Pages incompatibility with single page apps
        (like this one).
